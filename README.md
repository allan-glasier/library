# library

I created this to practice JavaScript Objects.

Currently Library is a simple page that show a list of books with their title, author, pages and if it has been read.

You can add a book, remove a book and toggle the read status by clicking on "have read: yes/no"

Next Steps:

- Add Firebase Support
- Clean up UI
